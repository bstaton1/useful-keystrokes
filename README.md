# My Favorite RStudio Keyboard Shortcuts
Because I'm frequently asked "how did you do that?!", and I find the [full list](<https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts>) overwhelming, I've compiled this abbreviated version. Enjoy!

This repository houses the source code for the document hosted [here](https://bstaton1.github.io/useful-keystrokes/).

Feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/bstaton1/useful-keystrokes/issues) with any errors you may find, or highly useful shortcuts you believe are missing from this list.
