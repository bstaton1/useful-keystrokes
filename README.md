# My Favorite RStudio Keyboard Shortcuts
Because I'm frequently asked "how did you do that?!", and I find the [full list](<https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts>) overwhelming, I've compiled this abbreviated version. Enjoy!

To access the list, simply clone the repository and open `useful-keystrokes.html` in your web browser -- create a bookmark for easy access. Or, you can build the list on your own computer by knitting the file `useful-shortcuts.rmd`. In addition to the packages necessary for knitting documents to HTML output, you will also need `dplyr`, `stringr`, `kableExtra`, and `htmltools`.

Feel free to submit a pull request or [issue](https://github.com/bstaton1/useful-keystrokes/issues) with any errors you may find, or highly useful shortcuts you believe are missing from this list.
